<h1 align="center">💡 How to Farm Balls with 100% Efficiency and 100% Safety</h1>

1. Create an alternate Discord account (alt).
2. Set up 100 servers using the following template:
   - **Name**: "Farm Server"
   - **Channels**: "General"
3. Add the Ballsdex bot, 3 bots from [Shapes Inc](https://platform.shapes.inc/) (The server count must be at least 5)
4. Join all 100 servers with your main account.
5. Configure Ballsdex and activate the Shape Inc bots to send messages in the channel whenever you send a message.
6. In the autocatcher's config, set "Farm Server" as the target for farming.
7. Run the autocatcher.
(It's important to note that the servers need to be 5 days old before ballsdex will start spawning fast)

With this setup, you can farm countryballs efficiently and safely!
