<h1 align="center">🚀 Let's dive into it</h1>

So, I think now we have all the requirements installed and ready. Lets start our journey with the codes.

<h1 align="center">⚙ Config files</h1>

First rename `config.js.example` to `config.js`<br>
Open config.js and fill out the values.<br>

When you are done with the file save it and dont forget to never commit it or sharing it publicly.

<h1 align="center">💾 Installing it</h1>

Head up to your terminal and run the following commands.

```sh
npm install
```

<h1 align="center">✨ Running it up</h1>

Now run the following commands in the terminal.

```sh
node index.js
```
**Common errors:**
- if u got an error showing `illegal hardware instruction` u need to run the code with an older version of sharp (0.27.2). to do that you need to run this command for startup:
```sh
node index.js --legacy
```
Now wait for the text (USERNAME is ready) and then your selfbot is online and catching countryballs automatically.<br>
Dont forget to star ⭐
